# I chose Xenopus tropicalis (Western clawed frog). Fun fact: members of the Xenopus genus were used in the 1930s as a pregnancy test, involving injecting urine into a live frog and seeing if she laid eggs. This method was highly accurate and in use until the 1950s. https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/doctors-used-to-use-live-african-frogs-as-pregnancy-tests-64279275/

## Looking over the annotation, I notice some things that raise question marks for me, so I would want to read over the genome report. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2994648/) I would expect to see close to the same number of five_prime_UTR and three_prime_UTR features, but there about a 10k discrepancy. Additionally, it seems odd to me that there are roughly 50,000 mRNA features annotated, but only between 20,000-24,000 gene features. Alternative splicing should give us a higher number of mRNA features, but it is surprising to me that it is more than 2x the annotated number of genes.
